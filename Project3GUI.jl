#When the column homogeneous is set to true, I run into a weird thing where the GUI freaks out and makes the keyboard keys super wide to the point where the 
#window for the GUI itself is distorted to no longer fit on the screen and is unable to be resized widith wise. Not sure how to fix this or what our options are from here. 
#My best guess is that the combination of elements (drop down menus, sliders, and buttons) works in a vertical orientation, but freaks out when you try to combine them horizontally
#which is why we get the weird distrotion.
